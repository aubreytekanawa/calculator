// WORK IN PROGRESS 

// 1. ROUNDING RESULT 
// Code for doing rounding to 4-5 decimal places max. Math.round()
// 2. RESET EQUATION
// Ran out of time to resolve issue but I need a function to resets the totalString value to the value of the last output displayed so you can do additional calcuations with the clean output. The function needs to clear the totalString value and copy the last output into the new string. function resetEquation(){ 
    // totalString = [lastOutput]; 
    // update();}
// 3. DECIMAL POINT FIXER
    // Need to replace this function with a for-loop to check the string array for where there are >1 decimal and the decimals are separated by numbers but are not separated by an operator which would indicate a legitimate equation string and console.log Duplicate decimal and prevent value from being inserted.
